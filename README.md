## Welcome to the Hadron-mod ðŸ§Š

### Brief description:
This is a project I enjoy working on in my free time, it's a modded Minecraft client which allows me to study both how the game works and how to manipulate game mechanics/code to obtain normally unobtainable behaviour (flying in no-fly servers, autofishing to find treasures, etc.).

### How does it work?
All of this is done through decompilation and deobfuscation of the .jar executable and by hooking game classes and functions to inject additional code. Both were performed using [fabricmc](https://fabricmc.net/), a framework created specifically for minecraft mods.

**Implemented functions up to now:**
 - Auto fishing
 - Flying inside vehicles e.g. boat
 - Simple toggle buttons inside game menu
